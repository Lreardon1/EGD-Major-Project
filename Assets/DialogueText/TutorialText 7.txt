*kisses the ground and starts praying*
MC|*has a proud look of determination for getting across*
*looks around at the new surroundings*
*jumps back as she sees the towering statue*
Godfather|*gets up off of ground*
Lets stay away from that. Who knows what other traps could be around it
MC|*starts walking forward*
*excitedly runs back to Godfather pulling him forward, pointing towards an exit to the cave*
Godfather|My prayers have been answered! God is trully amazing!
MC|*rolls her eyes*
