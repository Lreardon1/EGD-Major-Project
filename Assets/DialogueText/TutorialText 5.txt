Godfather|*walking slightly behind* Are we almost at the end yet? It's almost time for noon prayers....
*shouts in fear, almost walking off cliff*
MC|*points towards small clusters of rock floating in the air*

MC|*signs to Godfather to watch his step*
*points to a platform that doesn't look as stable*
Godfather|You go first *lightly pushes her from behind*
