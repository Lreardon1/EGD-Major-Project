Serena|*stops abruptly, staring at the vast chasm before them*
Godfather|*walking slightly behind* Are we almost at the end yet? It's almost time for noon prayers....
*shouts in fear, almost walking off cliff*
Serena|*points towards small clusters of rock floating in the air*
Godfather|Please, oh why. You know I'm afraid of heights!
If we fall, may God help the water break our fall...
Serena|*signs to Godfather to watch his step*
*points to a platform that doesn't look as stable*
Godfather|You go first *lightly pushes her from behind*
