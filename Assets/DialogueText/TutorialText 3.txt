Those cards really came in handy. Keep ahold of them tight
MC|*wipes sweat from brow and looks tired*
Godfather|I wonder how all of these people died here
MC|*looks around with a somber expression, glancing at the numerous graves*
Godfather|If it was the monster we just defeated, may they rest in peace.
MC|*nods in agreement*
