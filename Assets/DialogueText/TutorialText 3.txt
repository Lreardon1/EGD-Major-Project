Those cards really came in handy. Keep tight hold of them.
Serena|*wipes sweat from brow*
Godfather|I wonder how all of these people died.
Serena|*looks around with a somber expression, glancing at the numerous graves*
Godfather|If it was the monster we just defeated, may they rest in peace.
Serena|*nods in agreement*
Godfather|*quickly offers a pray to the graves*
