Bob|What are you doing?
@Steve|Nothing of note...
Just watching TV.
@Steve|Why?
@Bob|Just curious!
Godfather|Are you okay? What happened?

MC|I found this deck of cards just now....I couldn't see anything else besides them glowing ominously on the alter..
When I picked them up I could see everything again
