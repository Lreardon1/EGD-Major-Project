  dialogue:
  - Aren't you afraid?
  - 'Don''t look me like "what you are talking about", it sounds like I''m a coward. '
  - (The wind howls inside the cave.)
  - Okay, I admit it. I am a coward. Just stick with me please.
  - (Fedir puts his hand in front of himself, tries to push the mana and channels
    light magic, and failed.)
  - How we are going to...
  - (Serina pulls the left arm of Fedir before the ceiling falls onto his head.)
  - Thank goddess.
  - (Serina left him where he is, to let him think about his luck and his goddess.)
  - Hey, Serina, wait!
  - You sure it is the right way?
  - (Serine isn't sure, but she knows that it is the only way they have now.)
  - (After about 50 careful steps, their eyes got used to the darkness inside the
    cave.)
  - (At about 80 steps, they almost fall into another cave.)
  - (And God knows how many more steps were there before they could see a dim light
    in their sight.)
  - (Fedir was about to run in that direction, while Serina pulled his arm, saved
    him again from falling into another trap)
  - Oh, thank you
  - (Serina shakes her head, walked towards the source of light, and pulled that
    rectangular-shaped piece, card, out of the earth.)
  - This is...Here it is Serina! See! It is responding to your mana!
  - (Fedir stared at the right hand of Serina, which flips around the card between
    its fingers.)
  - 'And there is a stream of light coming from the dark cave, that penetrated throw
    the ground to appear in front of them. '
  - (Serina's hand faces towards the cards inside the ground. The ground starts to
    shake, then all the cards inside buried beneath vibrate and slip out of the earth
    beneath where they are standing.)
  - (A huge hollow appeared under her feet, and she started falling.)
  - Serina!
  - (Fedir tried to reach her hand, failed, and lost his balance, and fell into the
    darkness.)
