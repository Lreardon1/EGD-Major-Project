  - Please Warrior, you must help! My golem is malfunctioning!
  - Ah! Finally decided to show its true colors. Disgusting thing!
  - Warned you it would... malpractice, Mechanist.
  - Can't trust a golem...
  - Exterior influences, warrior. A glowing object suddenly appeared while we were
    exploring a ruin.
  - It seemed to be a card; my golem went haywire after it appeared.
  - Not helping you unbug anything again, but I'll smash it good!
  - A card?
