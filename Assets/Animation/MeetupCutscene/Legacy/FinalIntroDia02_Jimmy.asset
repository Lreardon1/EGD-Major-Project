  dialogue:
  - "Thank you guys, really saved my as\u2026 well."
  - "Are you an\u2026"
  - Yes, if you are asking me, an elf, call my Elean.
  - And she is?
  - I don't know. She just appeared and helped me
  - Elean turned to that minotaur warrior and asks,
  - What is your name? Do you want anything in return? I do have some money if you
    want, but not much tho?
  - Lala. I'm hungry.
  - "Food\u2026 Sorry, elves don't eat much. Do you guys know where is the nearest
    village?"
  - The church offers free meals. We should also probably go there, I am also hungry
  - "Eat.. Church\u2026"
  - Am I the only person with the fear that she might eat the church?
  - ...
  - So what went wrong with the golem?
  - What is it?
  - Elean found a golden card half way inside the feet of the destructed golem.
  - So this is the Wish Card?
  - Wish card? You mean that Wish Card?
  - The one could bring food?
  - No. it doesn't seems to be
  - Here is what is in that story
  - The midnight of blood moon, it is break the groun, rise from the earth
  - The tranquility, the aurora of trinity from water, fire and air
  - The card is revealed, and the fate would be changed
  - And nothing happened, just now
  - Isn't it just a myth? What if it is the real card?
  - It is not. Serina's mana does not flow through it
  - Serina nodded.
  - Then does the real one would allow her mana to follow through then?
  - What if the wish-card don't exist in the first place
  - Then we can get many other things from the journey!
  - Like what?
  - Love and friendship!
  - ...
  - And traveling with us is fun anyway, right?
  - Do you have a destination?
  - Here.
  - Where?
  - Follow the heart of a minotaur, it is always the right direction.
  - To the mountains of meat and fountains of wine
  - "How do you know\u2026"
  - Did you guys see serina?
  - Overthere.
  - I suppose that is where we would be heading right?
  - Yeah, at least my instinct also tells me, I can trust her.
  - Guys! I am hungry!
