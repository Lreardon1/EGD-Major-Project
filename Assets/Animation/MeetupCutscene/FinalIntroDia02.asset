  - Spill it, nerd. Was it the wish card?
  - Woah, back up!
  - We'll help you with your golem, so long as that quiet one gets the glowy card!
  - Do not offer up our time and safety for some imagined debt, hunter.
  - I'd gladly take your pushy help, cat, but I don't intend to needlessly risk a
    priest's life.
  - .... Nor Serena's....
  - '*Tugs pleadingly at the priest''s cloak.*'
  - Oh... you are dragging me so many terrible places today, Serena...
